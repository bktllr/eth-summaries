# ETH summaries
Summaries which I have written during my studies for the Computer Science Bachelor/Master at ETH Zurich. If you want to use some of these please be aware that:

- they have been written to explain the complicated stuff in the most intuitive way possible.
- they have been composed in the examination sessions the courses took place therefore they might be outdated depending on the course.
- they have been hand written by me on [PDF Drawboard](https://www.drawboard.com/pdf/), a tool which I highly recommend.
- they haven't been reviewed by any professor and are therefore not guaranteed to be correct.
